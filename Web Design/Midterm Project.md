### Midterm Project: Main Page Development

**Overview**  
For your midterm project, you’ll be creating the main page of your final website project. This will serve as the homepage, setting the foundation for the full, multi-page site you’ll complete by the end of the course. Focus on the core structure and essential styling, applying HTML and CSS as outlined below.

### Midterm Project Requirements

#### 1. **Structure & Content (HTML)**
   - **Homepage Layout:** Create a structured homepage that will welcome users and introduce the website’s purpose.
   - **Basic Elements:** Include a title, introductory text, and a placeholder for future links to additional pages.
   - **Navigation Bar:** Develop a functional navigation bar, even if it links only to the homepage for now. It should include placeholders for future pages (e.g., About, Services, Contact).
   - **Semantic HTML:** Use HTML5 elements such as `header`, `nav`, `section`, and `footer` to organize the content.

#### 2. **Styling & Design (CSS)**
   - **Responsive Design:** Make sure the homepage layout is responsive. Use CSS media queries to adapt it for mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
   - **Flexbox or Grid:** Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to structure the homepage’s layout effectively (e.g., organize header, content, and footer sections).
   - **Basic Styling:** Add fundamental styles, including a color scheme, typography, and spacing. Focus on maintaining a clean, readable design.
   - **Hover Effects/Transitions:** Include at least one CSS hover effect (e.g., on a button or link).

#### 3. **Version Control (Git/GitHub)**
   - **Git Repository:** Track your development using Git, committing your progress with descriptive messages.
   - **GitHub Repository:** Push your code to a GitHub repository and submit the link for grading.
