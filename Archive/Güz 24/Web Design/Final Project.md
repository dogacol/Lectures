### **Project Overview**

For your final project, you will be creating a fully functional, multi-page website. This website must demonstrate your understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, applying the skills you’ve learned throughout the course. The site should include dynamic, interactive features and reflect clean, well-organized code. This project will allow you to showcase your ability to build a complete, user-friendly web application.

### **Project Requirements**

Your website must meet the following technical requirements:

#### **1. Structure & Content (HTML)**

- **Homepage**: The homepage should welcome users and clearly explain the purpose of the website. Include navigation to other pages and a clear call to action.
- **Additional Pages**: The website should contain at least three additional pages (e.g., About, Services, Contact). You can choose the theme and content, but each page should have a meaningful purpose.
    - Example page ideas:
        - **About**: Describe yourself or your fictional business.
        - **Services/Projects**: Showcase a portfolio of projects or services offered.
        - **Contact**: Include a working contact form that uses JavaScript for validation.
- **Navigation Bar**: A fully functional navigation menu that allows users to move between pages.
- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML5 elements (e.g., `header`, `footer`, `nav`, `article`, `section`) for structure.

#### **2. Styling & Design (CSS)**

- **Responsive Design**: Your website must be responsive and work well on various screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop). Use CSS media queries to adjust layouts for different devices.
- **Flexbox or Grid**: Implement Flexbox or Grid to organize the layout of the website's sections (e.g., navigation, content, footer).
- **Styling**: Create an aesthetically pleasing design using color schemes, typography, and spacing. Use external CSS to maintain separation of concerns.
- **Hover Effects/Transitions**: Include at least one hover effect or CSS transition on interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links, images).

#### **3. Interactivity & Functionality (JavaScript)**

- **JavaScript Interaction**: Add dynamic, interactive elements to your website, such as:
    - A form validation script on the contact page (e.g., check that the user entered all required fields).
    - A slideshow or image gallery using JavaScript (optional).
    - A simple interactive feature such as a lightbox for images, a FAQ accordion, or a modal pop-up.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Use JavaScript to interact with the DOM (Document Object Model), such as dynamically changing content or styles in response to user input.
- **User Feedback**: Implement at least one feature where the site responds to user actions (e.g., a form submission success message, error messages for invalid input).

#### **4. Version Control (Git/GitHub)**

- **Git**: All project development must be tracked using Git. Make sure to make meaningful commit messages as you build your project.
- **GitHub**: Host your project on GitHub and submit the GitHub repository link for grading.

### **Project Timeline**

- **Week 12-13**: Work on project independently.
- **Week 14**: Submit the completed project (no class this week).

### **Submission Requirements**

1. **GitHub Repository**: Push your code to a GitHub repository. Include a `README.md` file that explains the purpose of your website, what technologies you used, and any special instructions for using your project.
2. **Live Website**: Host your website on GitHub Pages or a similar service. Provide the live URL.
3. **Final Submission**: Submit the following via the course platform:
    - Link to your GitHub repository.
    - Link to the live website.
