4. **Text Integration**: Add text as part of the design, demonstrating effective use of typography for titles, headlines, or captions relevant to the theme.
5. **Manipulation Techniques**: Apply filters or special effects, such as blur or liquify, to add depth, movement, or abstract qualities to the piece.
6. **Image Composition**: Combine at least two separate images into a cohesive composite, ensuring proper blending through techniques like color matching and blending modes.
